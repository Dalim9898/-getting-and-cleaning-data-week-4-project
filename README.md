# Goal of the Getting and Cleaning Data Project
1. A tidy data set
2. A link to a Github repository with my R script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. I have also included    a README.md in the repository.
